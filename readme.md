HOW THE GAME WORKS:

    It has 3 rounds where the final winner is decided primarily on the final score they get. If they get same scores then the time is checked. 
    If both time taken and score are same then itâ€™s draw.
    In this game the game directly starts with the player1 having the control.
    If the player crosses a fixed obstacle then the score of the particular player increases by 5
    If the player crosses a moving obstacle then the score of the particular player increases by 10

    In each round the turn of the particular player ends if the player hits an obstacle or moves to the end.
    If the player 2 completes his turn, then the round changes

    After ending of the 3 rounds then the screen prints the total time taken for each player and also prints the score and shows who is the winner
